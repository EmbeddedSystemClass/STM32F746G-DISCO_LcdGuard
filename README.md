# STM32F756G-DISCO LCD-Guard
I have broken the LCD touch sensor glass on my ST32F746G-DISCO development board.

I don't wanted to buy a brand new kit, because it is too expensive for me. On the other hand, the whole development tool was in good condition -except the Touch panel...-, eventually. 
So, I searched some more cost efficient way, and I found [Buydisplay](https://www.buydisplay.com). I have ordered a 4,3" sized touch sensor panel from china and I received that within 2 weeks.

## Mounting 

The broken glass was carefully removed, and the new one carefully mounted on top of the LCD panel.

The ordered touch sensor panel a little bit differ from the original. I knew that when I ordered, because I cant found original panel. The touch sensor arrived with a 0,5mm pitch sized FPC connector. 
My idea was the following. I wanted to use the connector, because soldering the FPC cable is not reliable. Fortunately, I had some adapter boards in my cupboard, which are waited for this time.

I cutted a slice from the adapter board, and the FPC connector was soldered on that. After, the finished unit was fixed on the back of the LCD panel and wired by 0.22mm wires.

## Printing 3D proterctor frame 

To avoid similar cases in future, I have designed a frame which will help to protect the display unit from the external impacts. 
Because the FPC connector and the piece of PCB are 4mm thick together, I have designed 4 spacer which will keeping 4mm distance between the LCD-TSP unit and the main PCB.
