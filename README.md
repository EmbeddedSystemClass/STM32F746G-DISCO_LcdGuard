# STM32F756G-DISCO LCD-Guard
I have broken the LCD touch sensor glass on my ST32F746G-DISCO development board.

I don't wanted to buy a brand new kit, because it is too expensive for me. On the other hand, the whole development tool was in good condition -except the Touch panel...-, eventually. 
So, I searched some more cost efficient way, and I have found [Buydisplay](https://www.buydisplay.com). I have ordered a 4,3" sized touch sensor panel from china and I received that within 2 weeks.

## Mounting 

The broken glass was carefully removed, and the new one carefully mounted on the top of the LCD panel.
